# aaa-timeline
Timeline JS API and site files created for ASU's Ask An Anthropologist project. 
Funded by the ASU Institute of Human Origins and the Office of Knowledge, Enterprise. and Development. 

This will be developed into a reusable API to create vertical timelines -- but for now it's a bit messy. Please ask if you have any questions.

Created by James and David Baxter.
